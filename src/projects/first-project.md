### aeu.. what?

Between May 2016 and June 2019, I was at the helm of aeuoeuâ€”a venture that rewrote the playbook on marketing and business. We intentionally broke conventional guidelines, embracing a hands-on, DIY spirit that many advised against. Instead of following the typical path, we built our own website, logistics, and even handcrafted our own boxesâ€”all starting from a modest living room in Amsterdam.

Looking back, those years were a whirlwind of challenges and victories. We were bold enough to forgo flashy branding and instead focused on delivering quality that spoke for itself. Our unconventional approach resonated far and wide, earning us a presence in four shops throughout Amsterdam and a loyal customer base that appreciated authenticity over trendiness.

On a personal note, those early days ignited my entrepreneurial mindsetâ€”a spirit that continues to inspire me today. Although itâ€™s been quite some time, the lessons I learned from this venture still guide my decisions and drive my passion for creating meaningful, quality-driven experiences. The journey taught me that success doesnâ€™t always follow the traditional rules; sometimes, itâ€™s about daring to do things differently.
