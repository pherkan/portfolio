### **Envision Glasses: A Breakthrough in Assistive Technology**  

Envision Glasses are **AI-powered smart glasses** designed to empower **blind and low-vision users** by converting visual information into speech in real time. They provide a seamless, hands-free way to **read text, recognize faces, identify objects, and navigate environments**â€”unlocking newfound independence for thousands globally.  

During my **Masterâ€™s program in Design for Interaction**, I conducted extensive **user research**, working closely with blind and low-vision individuals to understand their needs, pain points, and daily challenges. This research laid the foundation for what eventually became **Envision Glasses**, shaping the product into the powerful assistive tool it is today.  

What makes Envision Glasses truly unique is the **combination of cutting-edge AI and Google Glass hardware**. By leveraging **Googleâ€™s smart glasses platform**, Envision is able to deliver a lightweight, comfortable, and highly responsive wearable that seamlessly integrates **AI-powered OCR, real-time object recognition, and scene description**â€”offering an experience unlike any other in the world of accessibility.  

#### **My Role & Responsibilities**  
- Led **user research and testing**, ensuring the product met real-world accessibility needs.  
- Defined and refined **user experience and interaction flows** based on extensive feedback.  
- Worked closely with **engineers, designers, and external stakeholders** to iterate on features.  
- Contributed to the **launch strategy**, supporting early adopters and gathering user insights.  

Envision Glasses gained **early traction**, with **100+ pre-orders** before launch. Today, more than **3,000+ Envision Glasses** are sold and actively used by **blind and low-vision individuals worldwide**, making it one of the most impactful assistive technologies available.
