summary: What used to take me days of fiddling and research now takes just an hour. With Qoder and GPT-5 Codex, updating my portfolio site became faster, clearer, and a lot more enjoyable.
metaDescription: I recently revisited my portfolio site and realized it didn‚Äôt represent me anymore. Instead of spending days figuring out how to fix it, I used Qoder with GPT-5 Codex and reshaped it in just an hour. Here‚Äôs how.

Back in March I gave my portfolio a proper update. At the time I was happy with it, but about half a year later I looked at it again and realized I still didn‚Äôt like what I saw. It didn‚Äôt feel like me. It wasn‚Äôt visual enough and it just didn‚Äôt represent the work I‚Äôve been doing.  

Normally that realization would have meant days of effort. Looking up how to change things, testing out snippets, trying not to break anything in the process. But this time it took me about an hour.

## Why Time Matters  

For me, time is the most important resource. I care about my portfolio and I want it to look good, but I don‚Äôt want to spend days fiddling with research and debugging. I‚Äôd rather spend that time writing about this stuff (hello üëã), creating and working on the projects that actually matter to me, or simply trying out new hobbies like padel, golf, or bouldering. I‚Äôm still figuring out which one I‚Äôd like to continue with.  

So when it comes to something like a portfolio site, I want the fastest possible path to a result that looks right and feels like mine. That‚Äôs where GPT-5 Codex came in.

## Qoder and GPT-5 Codex  

Over the past few months I‚Äôve tried different tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code with Roocode. They each showed me how much AI-assisted coding has improved, but Qoder paired with GPT-5 Codex has been on another level.  

What makes Qoder stand out is how transparent it is. It doesn‚Äôt just hand you a block of updated code. It shows you exactly what‚Äôs changed, line by line. What‚Äôs removed, what‚Äôs added, what‚Äôs updated. That makes it easy to follow along and actually understand the changes. With Claude Code inside VS Code, for example, the edits often felt hidden and harder to follow. With Qoder I could see exactly what was happening and keep control over my site.

## From Days to an Hour  

Instead of wasting time on endless research, I just prompted:  
- ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs change the project cards to include a photo, using flexbox.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get rid of the photo on the front page and have a text in the center that follows H1.‚Äù  

GPT-5 Codex took those prompts and turned them into exactly what I had in mind. I could iterate quickly, like a conversation, until it felt right. The whole process was clear, fast, and surprisingly enjoyable.

What once took me days now happened in about an hour. And I still had time left in the day to exercise, watch a movie, and move on with life.

## Why This Is a Big Deal  

For me, the value is simple: I can shape my portfolio without losing days to trial and error. I still care about the look and feel, but I don‚Äôt have to burn time on the technical grind of figuring out *how* to make it happen.  

If you‚Äôre not experimenting with tools like Qoder and GPT-5 Codex yet, especially for smaller projects like personal websites, you‚Äôre really missing out. They give you speed, clarity, and freedom, which is exactly what matters when time is the most valuable thing you have.

## Old vs. New  

Here‚Äôs another look at how the update changed the overall hero section of the site.  

![Screenshot comparison showing the old hero section with photo on the left and the new hero section with bold centered H1 text on the right](/src/assets/img/pm_vibecoding_2_1.jpg)  

This is just the beginning. If GPT-5 Codex can shrink something that used to take me days into a one-hour task, the way we approach creative projects online is about to change completely.
