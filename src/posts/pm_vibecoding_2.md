summary: What used to take me days of fiddling and research now takes just an hour. With GPT-5 Codex, updating my portfolio site became faster, clearer, and a lot more enjoyable.
metaDescription: I recently revisited my portfolio site and realized it didn’t represent me anymore. Instead of spending days figuring out how to fix it, I used Qoder with GPT-5 Codex and reshaped it in just an hour. Here’s how.

Back in March I gave my portfolio a proper update. At the time I was happy with it, but about half a year later I looked at it again and realized I still didn’t like what I saw. It didn’t feel like me. It wasn’t visual enough and it just didn’t represent the work I’ve been doing.  

Normally that realization would have meant days of effort. Looking up how to change things, testing out snippets, trying not to break anything in the process. But this time it took me about an hour.

## Why Time Matters  

For me, time is the most important resource. I care about my portfolio and I want it to look good, but I don’t want to spend days fiddling with research and debugging. I’d rather spend that time writing about this stuff (hello 👋), creating and working on the projects that actually matter to me, or simply trying out new hobbies like padel, golf, or bouldering. I’m still figuring out which one I’d like to continue with.  

So when it comes to something like a portfolio site, I want the fastest possible path to a result that looks right and feels like mine. That’s where GPT-5 Codex came in.

## Working with GPT-5 Codex 

Over the past few months I’ve tried different tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code with Roocode. They each showed me how much AI-assisted coding has improved. But with GPT-5 Codex, the experience really stood out.

What makes the difference isn’t just the model but how it’s wrapped inside an IDE. Some environments show clear diffs line by line, others require a bit more manual work. In my case, having that visibility helped me understand what was going on, not just paste in changes blindly.

## From days to an hour

Instead of wasting time on endless research, I just prompted:  
- “Let’s change the project cards to include a photo, using flexbox.”  
- “Let’s get rid of the photo on the front page and have a text in the center that follows H1.”  

GPT-5 Codex took those prompts and turned them into exactly what I had in mind. I could iterate quickly, like a conversation, until it felt right. The whole process was clear, fast, and surprisingly enjoyable.  

What once took me days now happened in about an hour. And I still had time left in the day to exercise, watch a movie, and move on with life.

## Why this is a big deal  

For me, the value is simple: I can shape my portfolio without losing days to trial and error. I still care about the look and feel, but I don’t have to burn time on the technical grind of figuring out *how* to make it happen.  

If you’re not experimenting with tools like Qoder and GPT-5 Codex yet, especially for smaller projects like personal websites, you’re really missing out. They give you speed, clarity, and freedom, which is exactly what matters when time is the most valuable thing you have.

## Old vs. new  

Here’s a look at how the update changed the overall hero section of the site.

And how it changed the project cards into something much more visual.

This is just the beginning. If GPT-5 Codex can shrink something that used to take me days into a one-hour task, the way we approach creative projects online is about to change completely.

In a future post I want to show how GPT-5 Codex holds up when the project gets more complex. Think beyond simple UI tweaks, into more sophisticated features and workflows.
