summary: Vibecoding is reshaping how I work as a PM with a design background—turning ideas into working prototypes in minutes without needing to code everything myself.
metaDescription: As a product manager and designer, vibecoding lets me go beyond sketches and Figma files. With AI tools like Gemini and Claude Code, I can create working prototypes, test ideas faster, and add an entirely new skillset to my PM toolkit.

As a product manager with a design background, I’ve often felt like I had the tools to cover about 80% of launching a product. I was good at spotting opportunities and noticing where things could be improved. I loved talking to users, digging into their frustrations, and uncovering what they really wanted to achieve. I could sketch low-fidelity prototypes, test them, refine them, and think through the potential impact of what we were building.  

But then came the final stretch: turning those ideas into polished, high-fidelity prototypes or even better, working products. That’s the part where you normally needed to hire developers, or hope you had some coding friends willing to help out.  

Fast forward to today, and things have changed dramatically. Thanks to tools like Gemini, Claude Code, and other large language models (LLMs), that last step, once seen as “a developer’s job,” is starting to shift. More and more, the question isn’t *“Do we need a developer for this?”* but rather *“Can I just prompt this?”*

## So, what is vibecoding?  
The term *vibecoding* was popularized by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025. It describes a way of building with AI where you don’t fully code every detail yourself. Instead, you describe the outcome you want, the “vibe,” and the AI generates the code or prototype for you. It’s not about replacing developers, but about unlocking quick experimentation and bridging the gap between idea and implementation.  

For product designers and managers like me, it’s a game-changer. Suddenly, we’re not limited to sketches or Figma files. We can create working demos or tools ourselves, without waiting weeks for engineering time.

## A real example from my work  
At Envision, we hired a truly great design agency that came up with a beautiful branding style that included this dotted visual style. Besides the full branding package, they provided us with 16 of these dotted styles (see image). They also suggested building a custom tool that could turn any photo into this dotted style, but that would have come with a hefty price tag.  

A while ago, using Gemini, we built our own image-to-dot generator internally. No extra costs, no waiting. Just a prompt, some iterations, and suddenly we had exactly what we needed.

## Prototyping, reimagined  
Outside of work, I’m fascinated by what vibecoding can do for prototyping. In the past, I’d spend hours connecting screens in Figma, choosing interaction styles, and polishing animations. Now, I can create a prototype in under 30 minutes by prompting the right way and combining the right tools.  

For example, I recently mocked up an idea for how AI agents could change the shopping experience for a friend who has an online store. With Gemini and Veo 3, I quickly put together a working concept video with audio. In half an hour, I had something I could *show*—something that would have taken me hours in Figma.

## The limits (for now)  
Of course, vibecoding doesn’t mean we can instantly deploy everything to production. Building something scalable, reliable, and secure still requires proper engineering. But as a PM, vibecoding lets me go far beyond wireframes. I can bring ideas to life, test them faster, and communicate them more clearly to both my team and stakeholders.  

In a way, vibecoding adds an entirely new skillset to the PM/PO toolkit. I can ideate, validate, and now also *prototype with code* without being a developer myself.

## What’s next?  
Though vibecoding is great for concepts and prototyping, in my next blogpost I’ll write about my current love and hate journey of actually using vibecoding to make a public platform. More about that later...
