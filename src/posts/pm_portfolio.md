Ever since I started my career, I've noticed a recurring challenge in my circle of designer friends and colleagues: we always gravitate toward no-code solutions because they're quick, accessible, and simply get the job done. However, while these drag-and-drop tools are convenient, I began to wonder what I was missing by not diving into the world of code. If you're feeling stuck with an outdated, clunky portfolio or are tempted by the simplicity of no-code platforms, this article is for you. I’m sharing my personal journey of moving away from an old WordPress setup—plagued by high hosting costs, security issues, and legacy content—and embracing the code route that not only saved money but also enriched my technical skills and deepened my understanding of modern web development.


## Why I Decided to Move On
My old WordPress portfolio had served me well in my early days, but several factors made it clear that I needed to evolve:

- **Cost and Security Concerns:** My website was hosted on an expensive platform, and after it got hacked—cluttering it with bloatware—I knew it was time for a change.
- **Outdated Content:** The portfolio was filled with projects from my university days that no longer reflected my current professional journey.
- **Time Constraints:** Between full-time work, getting married, and [renovating a house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGTbGuxJpR8&list=PLyJjd5kOQVok-eHna_Ha5LDXtp8nNJHFM), there simply wasn’t enough time to keep the site updated.
- **Digital Home That Evolves:** I wanted a space that could serve as both a personal blog and a professional portfolio. Having left Instagram and X, I was looking for my own platform where I could share content freely without being tied to social media.


## Exploring Alternatives: Ready-Made & No-Code Solutions
I began by exploring several no-code platforms:
- **Super.so, Webflow, and Squarespace:** These tools offer attractive templates and intuitive GUIs—ideal for those who want to avoid coding.
- **Ghost and Framer:** Although Ghost impressed with its modern design, and Framer looked promising at first, both turned out to be quite expensive for a portfolio website.

These solutions work well for many, but I realized that by sticking with no-code, I’d be missing out on the opportunity to learn the technology that powers our digital world.

## The Netlify, GitHub, and 11ty Adventure

Determined to break out of my no-code comfort zone, I embarked on a more technical journey:
- **Choosing the Right Stack:** I settled on using Netlify, GitHub, and an 11ty template. I also experimented with Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, and Next.js, but 11ty struck the perfect balance between simplicity and flexibility.
- **Diving into Development Tools:** Transitioning from no-code tools to a code-based workflow was a major shift. I learned to use npm, npx, and Visual Studio Code. Now, I can quickly make changes in VS Code, see the results locally via localhost, and then push the changes to GitHub if I’m satisfied. The process of setting up a local development environment, managing packages, and deploying through GitHub wasn’t instantaneous—it took time, effort, and a lot of learning. Yet, every moment invested expanded my technical toolkit.
- **Guided by Modern AI:** Leaning on ChatGPT and Claude, I navigated troubleshooting and debugging. Their support transformed what could have been a frustrating ordeal into a series of manageable, educational steps.
- **A Designer’s Journey Into Code:** As a designer in university, my strong suit was design and UX. I knew the basics of coding but never really enjoyed it. However, as I pushed through this challenge—breaking my brain over new concepts—I discovered that overcoming these hurdles truly enhances your skill set and confidence.

## Embracing the Challenge

Taking the plunge into coding my own website was daunting, but the rewards have been immense:
- **Enhanced Technical Knowledge:** I now have a firm grasp on website architecture, version control, and deployment workflows. I’ve even learned how to manage DNS settings, transfer my domain from an expensive host to a more cost-effective solution, and host my email on iCloud (which I already pay for).
- **Greater Content Control:** My new setup allows for quick updates and seamless integration of new projects, ensuring that my portfolio always reflects my latest work.
- **Cost-Effective and Customizable:** By taking control of my domain and hosting, I’ve not only saved money but also gained a deeper understanding of how these systems work.
- **Personal and Professional Growth:** The journey has bolstered my problem-solving skills and boosted my confidence. It’s a vivid reminder that while no-code might be simple, the hands-on approach of coding your own site teaches you so much more.

## A Call to Fellow Product Managers and Designers

If you’re a product manager or designer with an outdated portfolio or if you’ve always shied away from coding because it seems daunting, consider this your invitation to step out of your comfort zone. Embracing the code route might appear challenging, but the skills and knowledge you gain along the way are transformative. Building your own portfolio is more than just a project—it’s a journey toward mastering your craft and unlocking new opportunities.

Moving away from WordPress wasn’t merely a technical upgrade—it was a transformative journey that demystified the backend, enriched my understanding of modern web development, and ultimately saved me money. If you’re on the fence about diving into coding your own portfolio, let my experience serve as a testament to the power of stepping beyond the easy path. No-code might be simple, but the code route teaches you so much more. Happy building!
