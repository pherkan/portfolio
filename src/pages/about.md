So, something about me I guess?

Well, I have a background in **industrial design engineering (BSc)** and **design for interaction (MSc)**. My journey began in **UX research** and then I progressed into **product design**, and now, as a **Product Manager at [Envision](https://letsenvision.com)**, i lead the development of groundbreaking AI-powered solutions for people who are blind or have low vision.

## my work at envision

at **envision**, i work on products like the **[Envision Glasses](https://letsenvision.com/glasses)**—an AI-powered wearable that converts visual information into speech, enhancing **independence and accessibility** for thousands globally.

my role involves:

* defining **product strategy**
* balancing **user needs** with **technological possibilities**
* leading a **cross-functional team** in a fast-paced **startup environment**

## what i do

As a **product manager**, i leverage:

* **figma** for design and prototyping  
* **notion** for agile project management  
* analytics tools like **google analytics** and **mixpanel** for data-driven insights  

My familiarity with backend tools such as **Firebase, Supabase** and **Gradio** enables me to collaborate effectively with technical teams, ensuring that our **AI and machine learning models** align seamlessly with our product vision.  

I combine:

* **data analysis**
* **user observation**
* **interviews**
* **co-creation workshops**  

to ground our products in real-world feedback.

## my approach

i’m committed to **continuous iteration** and **inclusive design**, updating our products **monthly** with new features shaped by our **user community**.  

with a strong foundation in **accessibility standards**, i ensure that our solutions are:

* **functional**
* **empowering** for users  

collaboration is key to my process, and i’m adept at **bridging diverse teams**, from development to customer support, to keep projects **aligned** and **innovative**.

## looking forward

i’m driven by a vision to push the boundaries of **assistive technology**, ensuring that AI remains a tool for **inclusivity** and **transformation**.  

my goal is to keep creating products that make a lasting, **positive impact** on people’s lives—**empowering individuals** with the tools they need to **navigate their world independently**.
